A person P wants to stand on the bottom of an inclined plane having an inclination of w = 30 degrees and throws a ball at an angle of e from the horizontal. The velocity with which that ball is thrown is v21 m/s. Find the value of 6 such that the ball achieves maximum displacement (d) when it hits the plane for the first time? g = 10m/s^2
