Slide 1: Title Slide

Title: Automating Tableau to Power BI Dashboard Conversion
Presented by: Priyanshu Rajpurohit
Role: Global Product & Technology Intern, ADP


---

Slide 2: What, Why, How

What

Build an automation tool to convert Tableau dashboards into Power BI dashboards.


Why

Tableau licensing costs ADP ~$1 million annually.

Power BI offers cost-efficiency and better integration with Microsoft tools.


How

Study both platforms (Tableau & Power BI).

Understand data and file structures.

Write Python scripts to automate basic conversion.



---

Slide 3: Why Move to Power BI?

Feature	Power BI	Tableau

Licensing Cost	~₹800/user/year (Pro)	₹30,000+/user/year
Ecosystem	Microsoft ecosystem (Excel, Teams, Azure)	Standalone
Learning Curve	Easier for beginners	Steeper
Data Modeling	DAX + Semantic Model	LOD Calculations
Governance & Security	Azure Active Directory Integration	Good but less native to MS tools
AI Capabilities	Copilot, Smart Narratives	Ask Data
Export & Embedding	Power Platform APIs	Extensions/API needed
File Format	.pbix, .pbir (open, JSON)	.twb, .twbx (XML/zipped)



---

Slide 4: Technical Challenges Identified

.twbx (Tableau) is a zipped XML package referencing external data.

.pbix (Power BI) is an encrypted binary file and undocumented.

No direct API for converting between formats.

Calculations, joins, and visual elements differ significantly.



---

Slide 5: My Learning Approach

1. Learned fundamentals of Tableau and Power BI dashboards.


2. Explored .twbx file structure by unzipping and parsing XML.


3. Identified mapping between Tableau metadata and Power BI components.


4. Built initial automation in Python.


5. Found .pbir format — a new, JSON-based format compatible with Power BI.




---

Slide 6: Workflow Summary

Step-by-step process:

Tableau (.twbx)
↓  [Zip + XML Parse]
Extract Metadata + Data Sources
↓
Mapped to Power BI Format
↓
Python script generates .pbir File
↓
Open in Power BI Desktop


---

Slide 7: Proof of Concept

Used dummy CSV data to simulate dashboard structure.

Parsed metadata from .twbx.

Generated .pbir with bar and line chart visuals using Python.

Demonstrated successful preview in Power BI Desktop.



---

Slide 8: Challenges Faced

Cannot programmatically generate .pbix — it's encrypted.

.pbir is in early stages — limited support for complex visuals.

Translating Tableau's calculated fields to Power BI’s DAX is non-trivial.

No Copilot access yet.

Waiting on Oracle DB credentials to test real ADP dashboards.



---

Slide 9: What's Next

Connect to a real Tableau dashboard backed by Oracle DB.

Automate mapping of relationships, joins, and visual elements.

Use LLMs (like GPT/Copilot) to convert Tableau formulas to DAX/M.

Explore Power BI REST APIs for automation and report publishing.

Build an extensible tool that works on various dashboards.



---

Slide 10: Final Thoughts

This is a technically ambitious and high-impact automation project.

I’ve focused on deep research and foundational setup.

The basic proof-of-concept is working; now ready to scale.

Looking forward to applying this to real ADP dashboards.

Open to suggestions, feedback, and team collaboration.
